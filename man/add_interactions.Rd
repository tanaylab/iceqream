\arguments{
\item{interaction_threshold}{threshold for the selecting features to create interactions. IQ learns a linear model on the features and selects the features with coefficients above this threshold. Default: 0.001}

\item{max_motif_n}{maximum number of motifs to consider for interactions. If NULL, all motifs above the interaction_threshold will be considered. Default: NULL}

\item{max_add_n}{maximum number of additional features to consider for interactions. If NULL, all additional features above the interaction_threshold will be considered. Default: NULL}

\item{max_n}{maximum number of interactions to consider. If NULL, all interactions will be considered. If set, the interactions will be selected based on correlation with the signal in the training data. Default: NULL}

\item{seed}{random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{interactions}{A precomputed interaction matrix. If provided, the function will not compute the interactions. Default: NULL}

\item{ignore_feats}{A character vector of features to ignore when creating interactions. Default: dinucleotides}
}
\value{
The updated trajectory model with added interactions.
}
\description{
This function adds significant interactions to a given trajectory model if they do not already exist.
It identifies significant interactions based on the provided threshold and updates the model features
with logistic features derived from these interactions. The trajectory model is then re-learned with
the new features.
