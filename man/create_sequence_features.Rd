\title{Create Sequence Features}
\usage{
create_sequence_features(
  intervals,
  size = NULL,
  normalize = TRUE,
  norm_quant = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervals}{A data frame containing interval information with columns \code{start} and \code{end}.}

\item{size}{The size of the sequences to extract. If NULL, the size is calculated from the first interval.}

\item{normalize}{A logical value indicating whether to normalize the features to the range 0-10.}

\item{norm_quant}{The quantile to use for normalization. Values below this quantile and above 1-quantile are truncated, and the rest are linearly scaled to 0-10.}
}
\value{
A matrix of normalized sequence features including GC content and dinucleotide frequencies.
}
\description{
This function generates sequence features from given intervals. It calculates
dinucleotide frequencies and GC content, normalizes these features, and returns
them as a matrix.
