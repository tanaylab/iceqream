\arguments{
\item{peak_intervals}{A data frame, indicating the genomic positions ('chrom', 'start', 'end') of each peak, with an additional column named "const" indicating whether the peak is constitutive. Optionally, a column named "cluster" can be added with indication of the cluster of each peak.}

\item{atac_scores}{Optional. A numeric matrix, representing mean ATAC score per bin per peak. Rows: peaks, columns: bins. By default iceqream would regress the last column minus the first column. If you want to regress something else, please either set bin_start or bin_end, or provide \code{atac_diff} instead. If \code{normalize_bins} is TRUE, the scores will be normalized to \link{0, 1}.}

\item{atac_diff}{Optional. A numeric vector representing the differential accessibility between the start and end of the trajectory. Either this or \code{atac_scores} must be provided.}

\item{normalize_bins}{whether to normalize the ATAC scores to \link{0, 1}. Default: TRUE}

\item{norm_intervals}{A data frame, indicating the genomic positions ('chrom', 'start', 'end') of peaks used for energy normalization. If NULL, the function will use \code{peak_intervals} for normalization.}

\item{motif_energies}{A numeric matrix, representing the energy of each motif in each peak. If NULL, the function will use \code{pssm_db} to calculate the motif energies. Note that this might take a while.}

\item{additional_features}{A data frame, representing additional genomic features (e.g. CpG content, distance to TSS, etc.) for each peak. Note that NA values would be replaced with 0.}

\item{max_motif_num}{maximum number of motifs to consider. Default: 50}

\item{traj_prego}{output of \code{learn_traj_prego}. If provided, no additional prego models would be inferred.}

\item{peaks_size}{size of the peaks to extract sequences from. Default: 300bp}

\item{bin_start}{the start of the trajectory. Default: 1}

\item{bin_end}{the end of the trajectory. Default: the last bin (only used when atac_scores is provided)}

\item{seed}{random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{frac_train}{A numeric value indicating the fraction of intervals to use for training (default is 0.8).}

\item{filter_model}{A logical value indicating whether to filter the model (default is TRUE).}

  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=regress_trajectory_motifs]{regress_trajectory_motifs}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{n_clust_factor}}{factor to divide the number of to keep after clustering. e.g. if n_clust_factor > 1 the number of motifs to keep will be reduced by a factor of n_clust_factor. Default: 1}
    \item{\code{norm_motif_energies}}{A numeric matrix, representing the normalized energy of each motif in each interval of \code{norm_intervals}. If NULL, the function will use \code{pssm_db} to calculate the motif energies. Note that this might take a while.}
    \item{\code{pssm_db}}{a data frame with PSSMs ('A', 'C', 'G' and 'T' columns), with an additional column 'motif' containing the motif name. All the motifs in \code{motif_energies} (column names) should be present in the 'motif' column. Default: all motifs in the prego package.}
    \item{\code{min_tss_distance}}{distance from Transcription Start Site (TSS) to classify a peak as an enhancer. Default: 5000. If NULL, no filtering will be performed - use this option if your peaks are already filtered. \cr
Note that in order to filter peaks that are too close to TSS, the current \code{misha} genome must have an intervals set called \code{intervs.global.tss}.}
    \item{\code{normalize_energies}}{whether to normalize the motif energies. Set this to FALSE if the motif energies are already normalized.}
    \item{\code{min_initial_energy_cor}}{minimal correlation between the motif normalized energy and the ATAC difference.}
    \item{\code{energy_norm_quantile}}{quantile of the energy used for normalization. Default: 1}
    \item{\code{norm_energy_max}}{maximum value of the normalized energy. Default: 10}
    \item{\code{n_prego_motifs}}{number of prego motifs (de-novo motifs) to consider.}
    \item{\code{min_diff}}{minimal ATAC difference for a peak to participate in the initial prego motif inference and in the distillation step (if \code{distill_on_diff} is TRUE).}
    \item{\code{distill_on_diff}}{whether to distill motifs based on differential accessibility. If FALSE, all peaks will be used for distillation, if TRUE - only peaks with differential accessibility >= min_diff will be used.}
    \item{\code{prego_sample_fraction}}{Fraction of peaks to sample for prego motif inference. A smaller number would be faster but might lead to over-fitting. Default: 0.1}
    \item{\code{feature_selection_beta}}{beta parameter used for feature selection.}
    \item{\code{filter_using_r2}}{whether to filter features using R^2.}
    \item{\code{r2_threshold}}{minimal R^2 for a feature to be included in the model.}
    \item{\code{parallel}}{whether to use parallel processing on glmnet.}
    \item{\code{spat_num_bins}}{number of spatial bins to use.}
    \item{\code{spat_bin_size}}{size of each spatial bin.}
    \item{\code{kmer_sequence_length}}{length of the kmer sequence to use for kmer screening. By default the full sequence is used.}
    \item{\code{alpha}}{The elasticnet mixing parameter, with \eqn{0\le\alpha\le 1}.
The penalty is defined as
\deqn{(1-\alpha)/2||\beta||_2^2+\alpha||\beta||_1.} \code{alpha=1} is the
lasso penalty, and \code{alpha=0} the ridge penalty.}
    \item{\code{lambda}}{A user supplied \code{lambda} sequence. Typical usage is to
have the program compute its own \code{lambda} sequence based on
\code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.min.ratio}. Supplying a value of
\code{lambda} overrides this. WARNING: use with care. Avoid supplying a
single value for \code{lambda} (for predictions after CV use
\code{predict()} instead).  Supply instead a decreasing sequence of
\code{lambda} values. \code{glmnet} relies on its warms starts for speed,
and its often faster to fit a whole path than compute a single fit.}
